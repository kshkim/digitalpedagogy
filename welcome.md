_Digital Pedagogy in the Humanities: Concepts, Models, and Experiments_, launched in 2015, is the MLA's second born-digital open-access anthology. The editors invite you to read these drafts and comment on them. The editors may then ask the authors to revise their work in the light of your comments, with the goal of eventually including the revised essays in the anthology.
